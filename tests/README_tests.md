## Test Folder
This folder contains wav file. 
The ones with short names are files not modified by our algorithm. 
You can use those for input. 

The letter at the end of the name specifies the key: 
Attention is in F#
Queen is in F (but one note that will be wrongly shifted...) 

The mention "detuned" means that we have artificially detuned the voice.

File with longer names are the one modified by the algorithm.
W is for the window_size,
FFT for FFT_size,
O for overlap
