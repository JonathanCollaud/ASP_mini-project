##Pitch corrector Voice Effect

This pitch corrector algorithm is organised in three python files:

* `main.py` : the main file that implement the pipelining of the different methods
* `methods.py` : contains the methods that are called from `main.py`
* `settings.py` : the settings that you can play with to adjust the voice effect

##Use

To launch the program, simply use the following command:

`python main.py`

##### Advice for the settings:
If using mic as input_type, put headphones, there is no larsen protection
The parameters to change for FFT_size is the power of 2. Change the value x in "FFT_SIZE = 2**x * window_size"

Precisions in the comments of `settings.py`
